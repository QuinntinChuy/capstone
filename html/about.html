                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>QuickClinique was born from a simple observation: healthcare in Cebu City needed to be more accessible, efficient, and patient-centered. Founded in 2024, we recognized the challenges patients faced with long waiting times, difficulty booking appointments, and lack of real-time information about healthcare services.</p>
                <p>Our team of healthcare professionals, software developers, and user experience designers came together with a shared vision to transform how people interact with healthcare providers. We believe that technology should bridge the gap between patients and healthcare services, not create barriers.</p>
                <p>Today, QuickClinique serves as a comprehensive healthcare management platform that connects patients with clinics, doctors, and pharmacies across Cebu City, making quality healthcare more accessible than ever before.</p>
